# Heading Shortcuts
A minimal plugin to add shortcuts to promote / demote / remove headings.

 | | Default Binding | Action
--|--|--|
Promote heading | `Mod + [` | Removes # from start of current line<br>(text ← H1 ← H6)
Demote heading | `Mod + ]` | Adds # to start of current line<br>(text → H1 → H6)
Remove heading | `Mod + Shift + ]` | Removes all # from start of current line

This plugin was created out of a need for a set of shortcuts to cycle through different heading levels like the built-in **Cycle bullet/checkbox** shortcut. If you prefer to cycle headings in the order (text → H6 → H1), consider using [kasahala's Heading Shifter](https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-heading-shifter) which also packs extra features. This plugin was intended to be no frills.
